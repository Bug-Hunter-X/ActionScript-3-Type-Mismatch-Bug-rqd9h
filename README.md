This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript 3 type mismatch error and its solution. The bug arises from passing a String argument to a function expecting an integer. This results in a runtime error or unexpected behavior, especially when implicit type conversion is relied upon. The solution shows proper type checking and handling of potential type mismatches.
